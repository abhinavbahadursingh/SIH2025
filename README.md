üö¶ Traffic Management System

A comprehensive Traffic Management System designed to monitor, analyze, and manage traffic data in real-time. This system combines a web-based PHP/HTML frontend for live monitoring and geofencing with a Python/Node.js backend for traffic analytics and vehicle classification.

üåü Features
Frontend (PHP / HTML / JavaScript)

Live Camera Feeds: View multiple live camera feeds (from YouTube) on a single dashboard.

Accident Detection & Reporting: Detect vehicle accidents and send notifications to Telegram with Google Maps location.

Geofencing & Vehicle Tracking:

Live Map showing real-time vehicle locations

Create, edit, and delete geofences

Maintain history logs of vehicle movements

Dashboard: Central dashboard for navigation across all modules

Backend (Python / Node.js)

Real-time Traffic Monitoring: Collect and analyze traffic data in real-time

Vehicle Counting & Classification: Categorize vehicles (bus, car, truck)

Traffic Congestion Analysis: Identify congestion hotspots

Interactive Data Visualization: Charts and graphs for traffic metrics

Alerts: Real-time notifications for unusual traffic patterns
